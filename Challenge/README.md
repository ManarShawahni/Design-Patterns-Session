# 🚨 Task Reminder System

This project is a **Task Reminder System** that **needs improvements** in its design.  
It currently lacks proper design patterns, leading to issues in **task management and notifications**.

---

## ❌ **Known Issues**

- **❌ No Singleton Pattern:** Task Manager allows multiple instances, causing inconsistency.
- **❌ No Observer Pattern:** Users do not receive task notifications.
- **❌ No Factory Pattern:** Reminders are manually created instead of using a factory.

javac *.java

2️⃣ **Run the program:**

```sh
java TaskReminderSystem
```

## 🎯 **Your Challenge**

✅ Implement **Singleton** to ensure only one Task Manager exists.
